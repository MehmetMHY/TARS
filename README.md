## About

TARS is our attempt towards trying to automate parts of cybersecurity penetration testing

## Long-Term Vision

Provide intelligent defense solutions by building AI-Agent based tools for automating cybersecurity penetration testing. In short, the plan is:

1. Build agents that can properly use existing cybersecurity tools for vulnerability scanning and threat analysis.
2. Optimize those agents to automate vulnerability identification and patching, instead of just scanning and threat reporting.
3. Build a reactive defensive system that can produce countermeasures against attackers in real-time.
4. (Long Term) Develop tools to prepare for a future where advanced, dynamic, and automated AI-driven attacks can be easily deployed.

## How To Run

⚠️ Warning: TARS has been tested on macOS and some Linux distros!

To run TARS, execute the main script, which will set everything up and run it too:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

Then, visit: http://localhost:8501/

## Run Formatter

Keeping the code clean, consistent, and well structured requires formatting. To do formatting for this project, run the following command:

```bash
bash fm.sh
```
