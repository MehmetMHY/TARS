# TARS

## Vision

Create a tool to automate the process of pentesting, allowing pentesters to do more with less and in turn make the world more secure.

## Events

(April 29, 2024) We are no longer participating in the Google Hackathon because Gemnei is a flawed LLM. GPT-4 seems to be the only LLM, right now, that works great for agents

(April 24, 2024) We are competing in the followign Hackathon: https://googleai.devpost.com/
